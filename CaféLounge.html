                            <p>Research and design a location based application to help find users restaurants</p>
                        <h3>Role</h3>
                            <p>UX researcher, UI designer</p>

                            <p>Sketch, UsabilityHub, Pencil & paper</p>
                        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                            <p>There is a market for location based recommendation app to find quality coffee, bakeries, breakfast, and brunch restaurants for adults with disposable income in metropolitan areas. This app will be designed to cater to those who are interested in artisanal foods. It will be a go to app for coffee aficionados and foodies who enjoy discovering local hole in the wall types of establishments that they can share with their friends. It differentiates from other apps by specializing for higher quality restaurant experience.</p>
                        
                    <h2>Objectives</h2>
                        <h3>Who are you designing for?</h2>
                        <p>Young professionals in metropolitan areas with disposable income that seek quality and trendy coffee, bakery, breakfast, and brunch establishments.</p>
                        <h3>What major goals and tasks will users want/need to accomplish?</h2>
                        <p>Find well regarded restaurants easily and view photos of the menu, food, and the interior design.</p>
                        <h3>What will the product do?</h2>
                        <p>Help users discover trendy and quality establishments and view what they offer.</p>
                        <h3>Where will the product be used?</h2>
                        <p>It will be used primarily by smart phones before work or while planning for a meet up.</p>
                        <h3>Why does the user need the product?</h2>
                        <p>User needs the product to find great cafes, bakeries, breakfast and brunch establishments. It provides users to easily achieve goals of looking up and assessing the quality of businesses.</p>
                        <h3>What kind of information will be created, entered, or featured in the product?</h2>
                        <p>It will provide directions, menus, reviews, photos, and reservation features.</p>
                        <h3>What particular business goals are you trying to achieve with this product launch?</h2>
                        <p>Increase user traffic by providing great service as well as allow users to discover great places to visit through advertisements.</p>
                    
                    <h2>User Personas</h2>
                        <p>I created user personas in order to imagine user’s needs and wants. By putting myself in the users’ perspective, it helped me better understand how and why users would use the app. A busy young professional, a food ethusiast, and a coffee shop reviewer were created to help approach the design process from their unique perspective.</p>

                    <h2>Flow Chart</h2>
                        <p>I mapped a flow chart showing all the pages and major tasks on each page. It helped me organize the navigational design and develop a sense of the flow of the app. For example, it shows the steps the users would need to take to upload a photo or write a review.</p>

                    <h2>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
                        <p>After developing the flow chart, I made a quick sketches of low-fidelity wireframes that laid out all the pages and its functions. These sketches prioritized overall design and placements of functional elements before focusing on detailed aesthetics. I made sure that all the buttons and icons would be easy to use and design pages with consistent design, such as placement of the buttons.</p>

                    <h2>Mid-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
                        <p>Next, I designed mid-fidelity wireframes based on finalized low-fidelity wireframes. During this stage, proportions and placements of all the design elements were fine tuned to develop a more completed visual structure.</p>

                    <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
                        <p>A/B testing was conducted via Usability Hub to gauge the font style preference by asking multiple testers to choose between two available options. 75% of the participants preferred Option A over Option B. Therefore, Option A was chosen over Option B. This testing was helpful because I initially thought that Option B was going to be preferred. Yielding statistics that differed from my expectations made me realize not to question assumptions and test out as much as possible.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>For this project, I was tasked with a comprehensive role as a user interface and user experience designer.
                            By meticulously engaging in the research process and analysis phase, as well as the interface design phase, I was able to learn multi multi-faceted nature of the application design process.
                            I developed a location-based app that helped users find coffee shops, breakfast, brunch, and bakery establishments. The app was developed by conducting a thorough interview process, A/B testing, and other research methods to gather useful data. They were then implemented during the designing process to build a user-friendly focused product.
                            Overall, this project was valuable in learning how to develop an application from the ground up. I’ve learned that although we tend to focus on the overall aesthetics of the finished product, it is just as important, if not more, to conduct comprehensive research and analysis for the functionality of the app. These design processes are always “shown” in the final product because they are functional designs rather than visual designs. I’ve learned that to develop a successful app, both functionality and aesthetics must go hand in hand.</p>
